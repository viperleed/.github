# ViPErLEED
The Vienna package for Erlangen LEED (ViPErLEED) is a comprehensive package aimed at making quantitative low-energy electron diffraction ([LEED-IV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low-energy_electron_diffraction)) easily accessible (for free) to the scientific community.

It comprises three main parts (conceptually independent from one another):

1. Measurement of LEED-IV 'movies' - currently in beta-test phase in the [viperleed](https://github.com/viperleed/viperleed) repository
2. Extraction of IV curves from LEED movies - see the [viperleed-imagej](https://github.com/viperleed/viperleed-imagej) repository
3. Calculations of theoretical IV curves based on a structural guess and optimization of the structure to best fit the experimental data - see the [viperleed](https://github.com/viperleed/viperleed) repository
