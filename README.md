# ViPErLEED
The Vienna package for Erlangen LEED (ViPErLEED) is a comprehensive package aimed at making quantitative low-energy electron diffraction ([LEED-IV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low-energy_electron_diffraction)) easily accessible (for free) to the scientific community.

It comprises three main parts (conceptually independent from one another):

1. Measurement of LEED-IV 'movies',
2. Extraction of IV curves from LEED movies,
3. Calculations of theoretical IV curves based on a structural guess and optimization of the structure to best fit the experimental data.

The package is currently in beta-test phase. The code is temporarily hosted in private repositories until the relevant manuscripts are ready for submission. We're happy to give access to anyone interested in trying it out: write an email to Michele Riva (riva@iap.tuwien.ac.at) if you're interested.
